    "Part II Recursive Filters. In this part, you’ll design low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-reject filters using recursive equations. It will be easier now to modify your filters for different frequency cutoffs. These filters will run faster than your convolution filters from last week, but keep in mind there is a trade-off that we will look at next week.\n",

Your low and high-pass function should take the input signal and $f_{c}$ in units of the sampling frequency and return the output after applying the filter to the input signal. The band pass and reject filters should take the input signal, centre frequency and bandwidth (both in units of sampling frequency)."
