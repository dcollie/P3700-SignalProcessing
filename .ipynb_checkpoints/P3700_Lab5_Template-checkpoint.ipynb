    "***4. Voice Scrambling, Spectral Inversion and Amplitude Modulation.*** *Amplitude modulation is an example multiplication in the time domain corresponding to convolution in the frequency domain. It’s also an example of how negative frequencies enter into everyday science and engineering problems. Modulation is the process of merging two signals to form a third signal with desirable characteristics of both. This always involves nonlinear processes such as multiplication; you can’t just add the two signals together. In radio communication, modulation results in radio signals that can propagate long distances and carry along audio or other information. We’re not going to merge your voice with a radio wave, but we can merge it with another carrier wave which while it’s being carried, will act to scramble your voice. This isn’t a secure method of voice scrambling. Chapter 10 in your text has a description of amplitude modulation. The following process is called spectrum inversion and as we’ll see, shifts negative frequencies into positive ones.*\n",
